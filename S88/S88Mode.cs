        /*This state is used when internal (inside this unit/machine and not from another
        machine on the production line) machine conditions do not allow the machine to
        continue producing, that is, the machine leaves the EXECUTE or SUSPENDED states
        due to internal conditions. This is typically used for routine machine conditions that
        require minor operator servicing to continue production. This state can be initiated
        automatically or by an operator and can be easily recovered from. An example of this
        would be a machine that requires an operator to periodically refill a glue dispenser or
        carton magazine and due to the machine design, these operations cannot be
        performed while the machine is running. Since these types of tasks are normal
        production operations, it is not desirable to go through aborting or stopping
        sequences, and because these functions are integral to the machine they are not
        considered to be “external.” While in the HOLDING state, the machine is typically
        brought to a controlled stop and then transitions to HELD upon state complete. To be
        able to restart production correctly after the HELD state, all relevant process set
        points and return status of the procedures at the time of receiving the Hold command
        must be saved in the machine controller when executing the HOLDING procedure.*/

        UNHOLDING automatically when internal conditions, material levels, for example,
        return to an acceptable level. If an operator is required to perform minor servicing to
        replenish materials or make adjustments, then the Unhold command may be initiated
        by the operator.*/

        reaching the end of a predefined production count where normal operation has run to
        completion, or externally generated, such as by a supervisory system. The

        conditions on the line. This is typically due to a Blocked or Starved event. This
        condition may be detected by a local machine sensor or based on a supervisory
        system external command. While in the SUSPENDING state, the machine is typically
        brought to a controlled stop and then transitions to SUSPENDED upon state
